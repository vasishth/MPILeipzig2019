# Motivation

## Important problems in all areas of science

Too often, ``findings'' in published papers are often:

- **non-replicable**
  - Replication attempt of Dillon et al 2013 (JML): https://osf.io/reavs/
  - Replication attempt of Levy and Keller 2013 (JML): https://osf.io/eyphj/
- **non-reproducible**
  - https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.180448 
  "*...suboptimal data curation, unclear analysis specification and reporting errors can impede analytic reproducibility, undermining the utility of data sharing and the credibility of scientific findings*."
- **contain (serious) mistakes**
  - https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02210/full
- **impossible to use for meta-analysis**
  - https://osf.io/dcbfz/
  - https://osf.io/g5ndw/
  
# Motivation  
## The underlying causes of these problems

- lack of statistical training in psych/ling
- experiments are run without checks or planning
- the result is a chaotic research process
- there is a culture of not releasing data with the paper

  **Actual data release statements**: 

  - "*Aggregate measures are available to qualified researchers upon written request*"

  - "*The raw data supporting the conclusions of this manuscript will be made available to any qualified researcher upon request.*"
- errors in analyses and coding waste researcher's time and energy


# Experiment design and planning
## Example: Subject and object relatives in Mandarin Chinese

- The research question is whether object relatives (ORs) are easier to process than subject relatives (SRs), in Mandarin Chinese. 

- In English, SRs are **easier** to process than ORs:

SR: The senator who interviewed the journalist resigned.

OR: The senator who the journalist interviewed resigned.

- Gibson and Wu 2013, and Hsiao and Gibson 2003, have argued that Chinese shows the opposite pattern (ORs easier). (Some background here: https://tinyurl.com/y69nqnyt).

# Experiment design and planning
## Example: Subject and object relatives in Mandarin Chinese

Existing data on Chinese relative clauses: Gibson and Wu 2013.

# Experiment design and planning

```

# Experiment design and planning

# Experiment design and planning
## Example: power calculation

- Conclusion: If we were to run a new experiment on Chinese RCs with 40 subjects and 16 items, our prospective power is approximately 30%.
- This assumes that the parameter estimates from the original data are the true values. 
- Note that we are uncertain about the effect estimate (and also the variance components). 

# Experiment design and planning
## Example: power calculation

Statistical power depends on

- sample size (subjects and items)
- standard deviation
- true effect size

For a full analysis, we should take these uncertainties into account. See appendix in J\"ager et al., 2017 (in the folder readings).

# Experiment design and planning
## Example: power calculation

How to take uncertainty about the effect into account? An example:

If we have $\pm 1$ sum coding, with OR coded +1 and SR -1, then:

Mean SR processing time (log ms): $\mu_1=\beta_0 - \beta_1$

Mean SR processing time (log ms): $mu_2=\beta_0 + \beta_1$

Since the model is on the log scale, we can go back to the ms scale by exponentiating:

Mean difference in ms in OR vs SR:
$\exp(\mu_2)-\exp(\mu_1)$

# Experiment design and planning
## Example: power calculation

Here is the model again:

```{r echo=TRUE}
m<-lmer(log(rt)~so+(1+so|subj)+(1+so|item),
        crit,control=lmerControl(calc.derivs=FALSE))
```

# Experiment design and planning
## Example: power calculation


```{r echo=TRUE}
## estimated OR-SR difference in ms:
exp(beta[1]+beta[2])-exp(beta[1]-beta[2])
```

# Experiment design and planning
## Example: Subject and object relatives in Mandarin Chinese


```{r echo=TRUE}
## what is the slope for an effect of 20 ms?
exp(beta[1]+(-0.024))-exp(beta[1]-(-0.024))

## what is the slope for an effect of 50 ms?
exp(beta[1]+(-0.06))-exp(beta[1]-(-0.06))
```

# Experiment design and planning
## Example: Subject and object relatives in Mandarin Chinese

Minimum power:

```{r echo=TRUE}
## there will be random fluctuation
compute_power(b=-0.024)
compute_power(b=-0.024)
```

# Experiment design and planning
## Example: Subject and object relatives in Mandarin Chinese

Maximum power:

```{r echo=TRUE}
## there will be random fluctuation
compute_power(b=-0.06)
compute_power(b=-0.06)
```

# Experiment design and planning
## Example: Subject and object relatives in Mandarin Chinese

We are now in a position to figure out, for a given effect size, what sample size we need (number of subjects/items) to obtain 80% power or higher.

Let's take the minimum effect size to compute a power curve. 

```{r cache=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
n<-seq(40,300,by=20)
pow<-rep(NA,length(n))
for(i in 1:length(n)){
#print(n[i])  
pow[i]<-compute_power(b=-0.024,
                      nsubj=n[i])
}
```

# Experiment design and planning
## Example: Subject and object relatives in Mandarin Chinese

```{r fig.height=5}
plot(n,pow,
     xlab="number of subjects",
     ylab="power",type="l",
     main="power curve")
```

# Defining the analysis plan using simulated data 
## Pre-registering the analysis

What is a pre-registration for?

[See: https://www.bayesianspectacles.org/a-breakdown-of-preregistration-is-redundant-at-best/]

# Defining the analysis plan using simulated data 
## Pre-registering the analysis

What a pre-registration is for (based on a twitter thread by Christina Bergmann):

- It allows the **researcher**, to clearly specify their research hypothesis in advance
- It creates documentation of the steps to be taken
- It can improve data management
- Makes a clear distinction between exploratory and confirmatory analyses
- Allows for improvements in design before the experiment in run

# Defining the analysis plan using simulated data 
## Pre-registering the analysis

What a pre-registration is **not** for (again echoing Bergmann):

- It doesn't improve theory (the Garbage-in-garbage-out, GIGO, principle)
- It doesn't guarantee that the study was of a high quality
- It doesn't prevent exploration or p-hacking

# Defining the analysis plan using simulated data 
## Pre-registering the analysis

Confirmatory analysis: Define the following in advance:

- the dependent variable(s) (in eyetracking, we have many choices)
- the region of interest/time window
- exclusion criteria
- the statistical model 
- expected results using fake-data simulation

**None of this prevents you from doing an exploratory analysis**.  See: https://osf.io/mmr7s/, https://psyarxiv.com/2atrh/

# Check that your experiment software actually collects the data you need and back-up your data

- Many people do not check whether their experimental software is actually collecting  data.
- The software repeatedly crashes during live experimental runs
- They only find out after the experiment was done.
- *Solution*: Before running the experiment for real, run the study once with one subject per group (in a Latin square design), and analyze the data fully.

# Once data are collected, visualize and summarize the data before doing any analysis
## Example: Chinese RCs data

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(crit, aes(x=type, 
                      y=log(rt))) + geom_point(position="jitter")+
  facet_wrap( ~ subj, nrow=6)
```



# Once data are collected, visualize the data before doing any analysis
## Example: Chinese RCs data

```{r fig.height=5}
p
```

# Once data are collected, visualize the data before doing any analysis
## Example: Chinese RCs data

```{r echo=TRUE}
p2 <- ggplot(crit, aes(x=type, 
                      y=log(rt))) + geom_point(position="jitter")+
  facet_wrap( ~ item, nrow=4)
```

# Once data are collected, visualize the data before doing any analysis
## Example: Chinese RCs data

```{r fig.height=5}
p2
```

# Once data are collected, visualize the data before doing any analysis
## Example: Chinese RCs data

```{r echo=TRUE}
p3 <- qplot(crit$type,log(crit$rt),geom="boxplot")
```

# Integrating the data analysis into the manuscript
# Workflow checklist

Before collecting any data:

- conduct power analysis using simulated data
- pre-register an analysis plan and time-stamp it (on osf.io or aspredicted.org)
- run the entire experiment at least once per group and analyze data to check for software errors

After collecting data:

- create a data repository (using github/bitbucket/osf)
- data analysis: 
  - visualize the data first
  - present the pre-registered analysis first
  - then do a separate exploratory analysis
- write code using R Markdown  
- release all code and data during review and after publication
- ideally: the paper itself should be the documentation  (Rmd  or Rnw).

# Integrating the data analysis into the manuscript
# some high-level coding suggestions

- write functions for common tasks and figure types
- never hard-code variables, this will make code non-robust to changes 
  (e.g., don't write ```num_rows<-500```)
- take the time to document code
- refactor code (simplify, write modular code using customized functions)
